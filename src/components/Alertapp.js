## <center>About using Actifit App</center>

----

#### What do I need to use the app?

You need a mobile phone operating with Android or IOS. You can download the app and as soon as you open it, it will instantly start tracking your activity. You will also need a steem account in order to post your activity on the steem blockchain. If you do not have a steem account, you can create one by [signing up](https://signup.steemit.com/?ref=actifit)

#### Where do I download the App?
[Playstore](https://bit.ly/actifit-app) for Android and [Apple Store](http://bit.ly/actifit-ios) for IOS.

##### Do I need a steem account to earn tokens?

You need a steem account to be able to post your activity from your mobile phone and to be rewarded.
In addition to that, if for any reasons you do not wish to download the app and  post Actifit Report Cards, if you have Steem Power, you can be rewarded with tokens for the following actions:

1. Delegate SP to be rewarded with tokens on a daily basis and on a weekly basis with sbd & steem power.
 *Delegators share a max cap of 100K AFIT tokens according to their delegation amount, and also earn a 5% beneficiary reward from actifit posts' beneficiary earnings.*

2. Interact with actifit users by upvoting or commenting posts (that have not yet received actifit upvotes) to get some extra actifit rewards

<sub>If you do not have a steem account you can sign up [here](https://signup.steemit.com/?ref=actifit) or contact @actifit to see if you are eligible for the creation of a free account.</sub>


![ruler0.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmURDM3SgiB7Wkvq7yDhPdsfNpCszwoiPS7hwQ9gYzZFqx/ruler0.jpg)

#### How do I earn tokens?
.1. The app auto-tracks your activity within the day. Make sure to post (if you have more than the minimum 5000 steps), before midnight.
At midnight, a new day starts and your activity count resets. A **'posting reminder'** was recently implemented in the app, so you can utilize it and make sure you do not forget to post!

----

##### <center> Posting reminder, aggressive mode and other settings</center>

---
<div class="pull-left">https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmc21QwrhgegZGQcjjfjfyto44JLWRv59aZTugXNWgYiUz/reminder.gif</div>

To post, you need to enter your steemit username and posting key.
(Check out here how to find your posting key https://d.tube/#!/v/raserrano/h7rze7he )
*Please keep in mind that you need a minimum of 5000 steps to get rewarded.*

After you enter the log in information (actifit does not store any of it, the information is only locally on your phone), you select your activity/ies and then after writing a short text (90 characters) describing your activity, you can click 'post' and post it on the blockchain.

When the actifit bot does its voting rounds, your post will be both upvoted, offering you Steem Rewards and you will also earn AFITs tokens to your account.

.2. When you delegate part of your SP to the actifit account, you also get rewarded daily with tokens.
*How to calculate how many tokens you will earn*
(Your Delegated SP) * 100,000 AFIT MAX / (Actifit Account Delegated SP - without account own SP and any delegators who opted out).
> Delegators share a max cap of 100K AFIT tokens according to their delegation amount, and also earn a 5% beneficiary reward from actifit posts' beneficiary earnings.

So for instance if you had delegated 100 SP, your daily earnings would be around:
100 * 100,000 / 213,000 = 46.94 AFITs

.3. Upvote or Comment actifit posts
Every time that a user explores the [created](https://steemit.com/created/actifit) actifit posts and decides to upvote or comment on them, both they and the post creator get rewarded with extra tokens.
**Tip** You can exclude all other posts by visiting the website actifit.io and clicking on *activity*

Please note:
- It is best if you upvote after the window of 16 minutes <sub>(this is a good practice for every steem post)</sub>
- You should upvote before the actifit bot to be rewarded
- If any system abuse, duplicate users come to your attention, you can let us know at [discord](https://discord.gg/aHtcA6r) or via email. Our goal is to  deliver better and honest content and to create a healthier, more active environment. Users who inform actifit about system abuse will be extra rewarded.


#### Can I maximize the tokens received?

Yes, following its users suggestions, it was decided to implement a new option, that when enabled, maximizes the tokens received.

Prior to posting your Actifit Report Card, click on *Maximize AFIT Token Earnings.*

<div class="pull-right">https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmcH5jc5opqZaL6GvvZw2fds2dptMzMAS94eZm4cwY6aCD/maximize.gif</div>


What this will do, is to set a new account that was created for those purposes, @actifit.funds, as the beneficiary of the remaining 90% of the post (already 5% goes to actifit.pay for delegators, and another 5% goes to actifit), so that you will receive 2 rewards:

The standard AFIT token rewards at the timing of the upvote, based on the existing reward system.

At the time of payout of the post, the amount of SP/SBD earned by the post, will be converted to AFIT tokens, and will be credited to the author. The calculation will be based on current STEEM price in USD, and SBD price per USD, converted per AFIT discounted offer price per USD.

The benefit of this is that you are earning **more AFIT tokens**, which would **increase your User Rank**, while also earning them at a **discounted price**.

You can also cancel any time by un-ticking the 'box'!


#### My post has not been upvoted. Why?

Maybe your activity was less than the minimum of 5000, or the bot has not reached 100% Voting Power yet.


#### My post had more than 5000 activity and was not upvoted.

In case the bot does not upvote a valid Actifit Report Card, it will be upvoted in next round with your current Report Card. Please wait at least 48 hours and then feel free to let the Team know on Discord.

**Please note**
> Some versions of **esteem** app still cause issues when used to edit your reports, via removing essential info Actifit uses to identify proper reports. This prevents related reports from receiving rewards. Until this issue is officially fixed via the esteem team, we advise that you use other Steem interfaces for editing, including our own actifit.io, steemit, busy or others.

##### How are actifit token rewards spread for actifit post authors?
<br>

As per a [recent announcement](https://steemit.com/actifit/@actifit/announcing-actifit-v2-reward-system-activity-content-engagement-user-ranks-delegation-moderation-and-more), the procedure for the Afit's rewarding has changed.

> **Reward Mechanism & User Rank:** The reward mechanism so far has been solely focused on recorded activity. The new system has come to change that and to further incentivize better content quality, but also further accumulation of tokens, as well as delegation to the system. The new rank system is based on delegated SP, tokens accumulated, rewarded activity and recent activity for the last 10 days. Each user's rank will affect their rewards and combined with the new approach to evaluate actifity posts/reports will reflect how many AFIT tokens and Steem upvote each post receives.

#### How is the User Rank Determined?

The higher the Rank the better and the more rewards you receive. User Rank is affected by 4 items: SP delegation to Actifit, AFIT tokens owned, total number of rewarded actifit posts, and number of actifit posts in the last 10 days. The more those components score higher the higher your score will be and hence your rank.

User rank itself has 30% based on delegated SP, 30% on AFIT tokens, 20% on total rewarded activity count and 20% on last 10 days activity.

#### What defines how my Actifit Report Card will be rewarded?

Reward System Percentages:
In short, 25% of your post score relies on activity count (minimum 5000 activity), 25% on the user rank, 20% on engagement (upvotes and comments it receives), 20% on content, and 10% on moderation.


#### Where do I find my User Rank?
1. Your rank appears on the app dashboard (open the app, at the top right you will see your rank)
![image1.jpg](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmVamU8VqPXXEtrvUY8SbjWEABiytHSaS9s8FWx96E9AkH/image1.jpg)
2. You can see your rank in the actifit.io website (after your log in with steemconnect)

#### Where do I find my wallet?
You can see it via the app itself (open app > View Wallet), or via the website [actifit.io](https://actifit.io/)

#### I believe that the app is not accurate enough, counting my activity.
If you are using Android, you can click on 'SETTINGS' and from there to turn on the Enable Aggressive Background Tracking. If you are on IOS, make sure you have the latest version of the App.

#### I have put extra tags in the tags section, but they are lost when posting.
You can use comma or space between the tags. The first tag will always be **actifit**. If you notice that the extra tags are lost, please try using commas instead of spaces, see if this solves it for you and let the Team know if the issue persists.

#### How can I increase my rewards and upvote %?
An Actifit Report Card is a steem post, and as such, its content quality is very important.
- Post good quality content and when possible, use good quality photos to go with.
- Post more frequently, so that your actifit ranking improves
- Do upvote and comment to other actifitters' posts and make more acti-friends.
- Delegate to actifit or increase your delegation amount.


#### If I upvote an actifit post before the bot, what determines my extra rewards?
We have  a max reward of 20 tokens per comment that has reached a min of 1 STEEM reward. If you are the 90% upvoter, you will get 90% of the 20 tokens.
AFIT stake does not affect your vote, your SP does, unlike your actual post rewards which are affected by your stake.
So, when you upvote an #actifit post *before the bot*, you are extra rewarded:
a. With AFITs (their number depend on your %SP and you get rewarded after the bot upvotes) and
b. With Curation Rewards (You are rewarded after the post's payout, with SP at your steem account)


#### What is the leaderboard?
The Leaderboard shows the 10 users who have managed to gather the top activity count for the day. You can check it at any time via your app, (your phone needs to be connected to internet to fetch the most current data), and you can see the list  of the top 3 if you visit the [actifi.io](https://actifit.io/#leaderboard) website and of course when following our [announcements](@actifit) you get to see our news along with the top actifitters and their rewards / activity!

#### When does the leaderboard restart?
Leaderboard updates every time a new entry gets in, but also once an upvote round takes place, all upvoted entries will be removed. So, an entry will show as long as it is not upvoted.

##### How can I delegate to @actifit?
<sub><br/>To delegate, you can use any of the following links below
[10SP](https://v2.steemconnect.com/sign/delegateVestingShares?delegatee=actifit&vesting_shares=10%20SP), [20SP](https://v2.steemconnect.com/sign/delegateVestingShares?delegatee=actifit&vesting_shares=20%20SP), [30SP](https://v2.steemconnect.com/sign/delegateVestingShares?delegatee=actifit&vesting_shares=30%20SP), [50SP](https://v2.steemconnect.com/sign/delegateVestingShares?delegatee=actifit&vesting_shares=50%20SP), [100SP](https://v2.steemconnect.com/sign/delegateVestingShares?delegatee=actifit&vesting_shares=100%20SP), [250SP](https://v2.steemconnect.com/sign/delegateVestingShares?delegatee=actifit&vesting_shares=250%20SP), [500SP](https://v2.steemconnect.com/sign/delegateVestingShares?delegatee=actifit&vesting_shares=500%20SP), [1,000SP](https://v2.steemconnect.com/sign/delegateVestingShares?delegatee=actifit&vesting_shares=1000%20SP), [5,000SP](https://v2.steemconnect.com/sign/delegateVestingShares?delegatee=actifit&vesting_shares=5000%20SP), [10,000SP](https://v2.steemconnect.com/sign/delegateVestingShares?delegatee=actifit&vesting_shares=10000%20SP), [50,000SP](https://v2.steemconnect.com/sign/delegateVestingShares?delegatee=actifit&vesting_shares=50000%20SP), [100,000SP](https://v2.steemconnect.com/sign/delegateVestingShares?delegatee=actifit&vesting_shares=100000%20SP), [Custom Amount](https://steembottracker.com/delegation.html?delegatee=actifit)</sub>
_Make sure you have at least 15 SP left on your account._

<sub>Attention! **When you want to increase delegation, you need to actually use the new _total amount_ as the delegation amount, and not only the increased amount. Otherwise only the new amount will be used, and the remaining will be undelegated. If you wish to cancel your delegation, please enter 0 as the delegated amount**</sub>

#### How much is the beneficiary reward for actifit when I post through the app?

When you do post via the app, @actifit & @actifit.pay are set as beneficiary accounts. @actifit account receives 5% of the post's payout and the account @actifit.pay will receive 5%, that will be distributed to the delegators on a weekly basis, proportionally to their delegated SP.

##### What do delegators benefit from?

Delegator Rewards: Delegators share a max cap of 100K AFIT tokens according to their delegation amount, and also earn a 5% beneficiary reward from actifit posts' beneficiary earnings.

Here is an easy way to calculate your AFIT tokens for a full day of delegations: (Your Delegated SP) * 100,000 AFIT MAX / (Actifit Account Delegated SP - without account own SP and any delegators who opted out).

So for instance if you had delegated 100 SP, your daily earnings would be around: 100 * 100,000 / 216,000 = 46.29 AFITs

- 5% beneficiary reward from actifit posts, meaning when a user creates a post via our app, 5% of the reward of the post will actually be sent back to delegators and split among them according to how much they delegated.

##### How does the 5% beneficiary get split?
There is an account called actifit.pay, which is set as 5% beneficiary for every actifit post and this account accumulates he 5% beneficiary on the payout of each post at the end of a week.
Every week, the delegations received from all of our delegators for this week's period in total SP are calculated and split that 5% amount accumulated in the account.

*This applies to 2 weeks before. Let's say you delegated week 1, so at the end of week 2, you would get a portion of the beneficiary payments. Reason being is that post payouts actually happen after 7 days, and so your SP was used in the week before and you are rewarded for using your SP as beneficiary*

## <center> About AFIT tokens</center>

#### How much will the total supply in TOKENS be?
The total supply will be 2.1 Billion Tokens
[source](https://steemit.com/actifit/@actifit/actifit-android-v0-4-0-beta-launched-image-uploads-maximizing-afit-earnings-afit-pricing-and-supply-charts-security-and-more)

#### How much is the price?

For the pricing, the actifit team made their financial studies, projections and valuation of the potential starting market price for AFIT tokens, similarly to how other cryptos would do.
The pricing  set is 12.5 cents at around the launch of SMTs. The Team decided to give the community the option to bulk up on more tokens early on, and provide a discount for anyone acquiring AFIT tokens before the  planned SMT price is reached. Additional options to acquire AFIT tokens during this period to maximize profit for early adopter, will be provided.

<center>![](https://i.imgur.com/XX94zR7.png)</center>

#### Where can I see how many tokens have been distributed?
You can visit the website [actifit.io](https://actifit.io/) for the most updated information regarding AFITs

![](https://cdn.steemitimages.com/DQmRUphYEVdL8gevst8Hww3bt9agkT6V74jSPDS86chRfbX/image.png)
<center>(screenshot actifit.io | date 20 November 2018)</center>

#### Are there cases that you revoke users' tokens?
Yes, when users are found abusing our system and not following the [terms of service](https://actifit.io/terms-conditions) we will remove all distributed tokens and put them back in the pool.

## <center> About Rewards - Ranking </center>

#### If I upvote an actifit user's latest Actifit Report Card and upvote at 100% of my Steem power and leave a comment. Does this help his payout in Actifit Tokens and influence his rank in any way? Does my upvote and comment influence my rank in anyway? Or would this come by him coming to my post and upvoting/leaving a comment/or both?
*(question asked by @wil.metcafe which we include as originally posted in the discord channel)*

The higher your upvote is, the higher is your reward. The more upvotes the user gets, the higher his reward. Your comment also helps him get more rewards.

In short:
25% of your post score relies on activity count
25% on the user rank
20% on engagement (upvotes and comments it receives)
20% on content and
10% on moderation.

User rank itself has 30% based on SP, 30% on AFIT tokens, 20% on total rewarded activity count and 20% on last 10 days activity


#### I have missed a couple of days / posts and now my rank has dropped. Why?

We count the reports of the last 10 days for defining a user;s ranking. As long as you get 9 or 10 reports in the last 10 days, you get a full score on your recent activity portion. So we advise everyone to stay active and post daily.

#### Is there a certain time in the day when the upvotes are given to latest posts?

The actifit bot runs when it reaches 100% voting power and starts rewarding and upvoting posts. After it runs and upvotes; it should run again in less than 24 hrs

You can check the actifit VP by visiting https://steemworld.org/@actifit


---

#### How are/will the actifit tokens used?

The plans are to have Actifit tokens available for purchasing fitness related equipment, tools, gadgets, sports wear and enable transactions between providers and actifitters.
Also, when SMTs are launched,  Actifit tokens will have their own valuation against STEEM as well as FIAT currencies, and hence can be cashed out for actual FIAT currency.

Just recently the devs managed to read data from [FITBIT users](https://steemit.com/actifit/@actifit/actifit-daily-fitbit-integration-almost-ready-increased-post-upvote-wait-time-top-daily-actifitters), this is a step that is bringing wearables integrations even closer!

#### Where do I see my AFIT tokens balance?
1. Through the app > View Wallet > Input your steemit username without the @ and then > Check Balance
2. Through [SteemConnect](https://v2.steemconnect.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=actifit.app&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Factifit.io%2Fauth&scope=vote,comment) > visit [actifit.io](https://actifit.io/) and click on `sign in`


#### Why doesn't my wallet reflect my upvote and delegation earned tokens?
The upvote tokens & delegation tokens are updated within 24 hours of the actual upvote/reward session. So on any given day, you should see the tokens for the past day rewards.

#### How many activities can/should I choose?

Be honest, post an image and a relevant story/text of your activity.

Please note that abusive selection of multiple activities would lead to your ban from the actifit program. Please make sure to only select the actual activities you did within the day.

#### Do you have a posting policy?

You can check the actifit & steemit etiquette [here](https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@katerinaramm/actifit-etiquette-content-posting-guidelines)

## <center>Alternative Accounts </center>

We have recently implemented a new delegation beneficiary feature, targeted to help actifitters who own 2 accounts (a normal account and an alt account just for actifit). These users now can benefit as follows:

- Transition delegation User Rank value from the main account to the alt-account. So let's say for example user john has his main account "john", which he uses to delegate to Actifit, and an actifit-specific account "acti-john" that he uses to post. Normally the account "acti-john" is not benefiting from the delegated amount to increase his User Rank. Now with the new development we made, john can decide that his acti-john account would be the one to receive the increase in User Rank.

- Transition AFIT token delegation rewards to the alt-account. Under this setting, the user acti-john will also be the recipient of the daily delegation rewards that the user john normally receives. This will also indirectly benefit the User Rank of the example account above acti-john by accumulating more tokens, and hence the possibility to increase User Rank as well on a longer run.

- Transition STEEM+SBD delegation rewards to the alt-account. Similarly to option above, you can also opt in to have your STEEM/SBD weekly earnings be sent to your alt account instead of your main account.

#### Is this optional or am I required to inform you?
You can opt in for one or more combination of the above. It is optional for the users.

#### I wish to combine my alt accounts rewards. What should I do?

1. Please contact one of our moderators on discord

2. Show proof of ownership of both accounts

3. Confirm your choice of which you options you would like enabled; option 1: User Rank Grade Beneficiary, option 2: Delegation AFIT Rewards Beneficiary, option 3: Delegation STEEM Rewards Beneficiary.

Once confirmed, we will set this up for you in our system, and it will become active on the next delegation payout round.

#### How about previous rewarded AFITs? Can they be moved?
At the moment this is not possible.
